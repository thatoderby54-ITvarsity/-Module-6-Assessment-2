                    <h1>FORD RANGER</h1>
                    <p>The Ford Range is one of those cars. It feels like one of the quintessential cars that every South African has experienced at some point in their lives. Whether it be driving to school sitting in the back of one or witnessing some jackass driving on rage down the N3, one doesn’t need to think back too far to remember the Ford Ranger making some kind of impression. Which is why Ford’s Ranger Thunder announcement is so cool as it takes one of the most iconic bakkies around and supes it up with some very snazzy new features.</p>

                    <h1>2018 MERCEDES-AMG C63</h1>
                    <p>The 2018 Mercedes-AMG C63 S packs a 503-horsepower punch from its beefy V8 biturbo engine. The chassis remains composed even under pressure and boasts gobs of grip. In its Comfort mode, the C63 S is a well-appointed and understated daily driver.</p>

                    <h1>POLO GTI</h1>
                    <p>For two decades, there has not only been a Golf GTI but also a Polo GTI. The latest generation certainly has an impressive performance; with a power output of 147 kW / 200 PS and the standard six-speed DSG gearbox, the model has a maximum speed of 237 km/h and can accelerate to 100 km/h from standstill in 6.7 seconds. The efficiency of the drivetrain is reflected by a consumption figure of 5.9 l/100 km. Just climb in, adjust the sports seats and fasten your seatbelt and you have an ergonomically tailored interaction between driver and machine. The Polo GTI combines extremely high performance with very high levels of safety and comfort.</p>
